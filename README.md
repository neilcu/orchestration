# orchestration
ctm aapi event orchestration

This handler takes a filename as input then reads a Control-M JSON template.

The template has variables that need replacing prior to writing it out to be submitted to Control-M for processing.
This code can be modified like in the other examples for GCP functions and aws Lambda.
See the other examples for reference.
